# flyPanels v4.0.1

flyPanels - responsive off canvas menu panels

## Features

FlyPanels is a responsive off canvas menu plugin for websites or web apps. It supports all modern browsers from IE11. This new version is written in vanilla JavaScript and has no other dependencies. The old jQuery version can still be accessed on a [separate branch called jQuery](https://github.com/SubZane/flyPanels/tree/jQuery). Take note that the old jQuery version will not receive as much attention from me as I'm moving away from jQuery.

Compared to many other off canvas menu plugins out there this one is more solid and behaves more like a native solution. Try it!

### Typical setup

This could be your typical script setup.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) {
	flyPanels.init();
});
```

### Html needed for a basic setup

```html
<div class="flypanels-overlay"></div>
<div id="flypanels-menubutton" class="flypanels-button menu" data-target="flypanels-menu"></div>
<div id="flypanels-menu" class="flypanels-panel door-left">
	<div class="flypanels-content door-left">
		<div class="flypanels-inner">
			<p>panel content goes here</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Using the expanding treemenu component

If you want to use the treemenu component you'll need to set it to true in the options and you'll need to add the necessary HTML markup.

To customize the appearance of the treemenu you can either modify the LESS files and rebuild or just simply override the default styles.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) {
	flyPanels.init({
		onInit: function () {
			fpm_treemenu.init();
		},
	});
});
```

```html
<div class="flypanels-overlay"></div>
<div id="flypanels-menubutton" class="flypanels-button menu" data-target="flypanels-menu"></div>
<div id="flypanels-menu" class="flypanels-panel door-left">
	<div class="flypanels-content door-left">
		<div class="flypanels-inner">
			<nav class="flypanels-treemenu" role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation" id="flypanels-treemenu">
				<ul>
					<li class="haschildren">
						<a href="#"
							><span class="link">Example menu item</span> <span class="expand">2<i class="fa icon"></i></span
						></a>
						<ul>
							<li class="haschildren">
								<a href="#"
									><span class="link">Example menu item</span> <span class="expand">2<i class="fa icon"></i></span
								></a>
								<ul>
									<li class="haschildren">
										<a href="#"
											><span class="link">Example menu item</span> <span class="expand">2<i class="fa icon"></i></span
										></a>
										<ul>
											<li class="haschildren">
												<a href="#"
													><span class="link">Example menu item</span> <span class="expand">2<i class="fa icon"></i></span
												></a>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<a href="#"><span class="link">Example menu item</span></a>
													</li>
													<li>
														<a href="#"><span class="link">Example menu item</span></a>
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="#"><span class="link">Example menu item</span></a>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#"><span class="link">Example menu item</span></a>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#"><span class="link">Example menu item</span></a>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</nav>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Using the expanding treemenu component with JSON

If you want to use the treemenu component with JSON as data srouce you'll need to set it to true in the options and you'll need to add the necessary HTML markup. You will also need to specify the URL to the JSON file in the data attribute `data-json`.

To customize the appearance of the treemenu you can either modify the LESS files and rebuild or just simply override the default styles.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) {
	flyPanels.init({
		onInit: function () {
			fpm_treemenu.init({
				UseJSON: true,
			});
		},
	});
});
```

```html
<div class="flypanels-overlay"></div>
<div id="flypanels-menubutton" class="flypanels-button menu" data-target="flypanels-menu"></div>
<div id="flypanels-menu" class="flypanels-panel door-left">
	<div class="flypanels-content door-left">
		<div class="flypanels-inner">
			<nav class="flypanels-treemenu" role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation" data-json="json/treemenu.json" id="flypanels-treemenu">
				<!-- Tree Menu will render here. Please keep template below -->
				<ul>
					<li class="haschildren" role="treeitem" aria-expanded="false">
						<div>
							<a href="{url}" class="link">{title}</a
							><a aria-label="Expand submenu" href="#" data-aria-label="Expand submenu" data-aria-label-active="Collapse submenu" class="expand"
								>{count}<i class="fa icon" aria-hidden="true"></i
							></a>
						</div>
						<ul>
							<li class="nochildren">
								<div><a href="{url}" class="link">{title}</a></div>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<!-- End: Tree Menu will render here.  Please keep template below -->
			</nav>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Using the search component

If you want to use the search component you'll need to set it to true in the options and you'll need to add the necessary HTML markup.

To customize the appearance of the search panel and its result you can either modify the LESS files and rebuild or just simply override the default styles.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) {
	flyPanels.init({
		onInit: function () {
			fpm_search.init({ saveQueryCookie: true });
		},
	});
});
```

```html
<div class="flypanels-overlay"></div>
<div id="flypanels-searchbutton" class="flypanels-button search" data-target="flypanels-search"></div>
<div id="flypanels-search" class="flypanels-panel door-right">
	<div class="flypanels-content door-right">
		<div class="flypanels-inner">
			<div class="searchpanel">
				<div class="searchbox" data-searchurl="json/searchresult.json?search=true">
					<input title="search" type="text" id="flypanels-searchfield" />
					<a href="#" aria-label="search" class="searchbutton"></a>
				</div>
				<div class="resultinfo" aria-live="polite" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
					You search for "<span class="query">lorem ipsum</span>" resulted in <span class="num">5</span> hits.
				</div>
				<div class="errormsg" aria-live="polite" aria-hidden="true" hidden>Something went wrong, please refresh the page and try again.</div>

				<div class="loading" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
					<div class="loader"></div>
					<span>Searching...</span>
				</div>
				<div class="flypanels-searchresult" aria-hidden="true" aria-live="polite" hidden></div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

- Minor fixes and cleanup of code

#### 4.0.0

- Note: The treemenu and search components still works exactly the same.

#### 3.2.0

- New: Added support for generating a treemenu from a JSON file.

#### 3.1.1

- FIX: Repository bug

#### 3.1.0

- Moved from Bower to Yarn

#### 3.0.0

- New modular approach. Both the search and treemenu are now separate scripts that need to be incluced if needed.
- Sizing adjusted from pixel sizing to viewport sizing for a more responsive approach. Markup and CSS Changed.
- The panel widths are now possible to adjust depending on screen size using media queries. Default it uses the breakpoints defined by Bootstrap.

#### 2.0.4

- Fix: Bug with the search not removing previous search results if new query results in zero hits.

#### 2.0.3

- Fix: Bug with the search not handling zero results properly and not hiding the spinner after a search.

#### 2.0.2

- Fix: A case where flyPanels made RoyalSlider to not work after a panel has been opened. It seems that using 'innerHTML' to add elements to the DOM made RoyalSlider to stop working. Rewrote my function to not use innerHTML. Now it works just fine. Who would have known, eh?

#### 2.0.1

- Fix: The CSS contained some too new rules that prevented it from working at all in iOS8. Added CSS prefixes to fix it.
- Change: Added autoprefixer to the build.

#### 2.0.0

- BIG CHANGE: Rewrote the plugin in vanilla JavaScript. jQuery is no longer required. Last version to use jQuery is 0.14.0
- Change: Smoother CSS transitions and changed animation structure for faster Paint and Layout
- Change: Removed legacy support for LESS. flyPanels now only supports SCSS

#### 0.12.0

- Added CSS class for active menu item.

#### 0.11.2

- Renamed all LESS variables. Added prefix `flypanels_` to all.

#### 0.11.1

- The search result shouldn't be a `nav` element. Changed to a `div`. LESS file updated as well.

#### 0.11.0

- Updated the HTML markup for the treemenu component for a more accessible menu. Switched out `span` elements for `a` link elements
- Addressed some issues with horizontal scrollbars caused by scrollbars on units with visible scrollbars. Horizontal overflow in the panels is now set to `overflow-x:hidden` and vertical scroll is now set to auto `overflow-y:auto`. This is maybe not the best solution to address scrollbar width.

#### 0.10.4

- Fixed bug with topbar not being fixed because of `translate3d`.

#### 0.10.3

- Bug fix: Errors in the CSS preventing the panels to work in Firefox.

#### 0.10.2

- Small fix: Removing and adding classes when opening and closing panels wasn't working properly resulting in unwanted scroll.

#### 0.10.0

- Added search panel. This is a panel with an search form that calls a URL with a querystring passing along a keyword expecting a JSON response. Use this to produce a search result in the panel. Look at the dummy JSON file to understand on how the JSON format should be.
- Added search settings. Default the search features will not init, just like the tree menu component it must be set to true to init.

#### 0.9.1

- Added a `preload` class to the container wich is removed at page load, to prevent objects from animating to their starting positions.

#### 0.9.0

- Removed support for IE9
- Removed the need for jquery.transit. Making the whole script as such smaller.
- Added CSS3 translate3d animations for better and smoother animations.
